## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Demo Version (No Setup Required)
Open `demo.html` in your browser to see the full system in action with mock data.

### Option 2: Full Development Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Backend Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server runs on port 8081

3. **Start Frontend (in another terminal)**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```
   Frontend runs on port 3000

4. **Open Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## 📊 Trading Algorithm

### Final Score Formula
```
Final Score = 40% RSI+MACD + 25% Smart Money + 20% Patterns + 10% Sentiment + 5% ML
```

### Signal Generation
- **BUY Signal (Score > 70)**: RSI < 30, MACD bullish, positive sentiment, whale buying
- **SELL Signal (Score < 30)**: RSI > 70, MACD bearish, negative sentiment, whale selling
- **HOLD Signal (Score 30-70)**: Mixed signals, wait for confirmation
