# Redis Setup Complete ✓

## Issue Resolved
The application was failing to connect to Redis with the error:
```
Failed to connect to Redis: Error Multiple exceptions: [Errno 10061] Connect call failed ('::1', 6379, 0, 0), [Errno 10061] Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 6379) connecting to localhost:6379.
```

## Actions Taken

### 1. Redis Server Installation
- Installed Redis server on the system using `apt-get`
- Redis version: 5:7.0.15-3ubuntu0.1

### 2. Redis Service Started
- Started the Redis service successfully
- Redis is now running on localhost:6379 (default port)
- Process ID: 1084

### 3. Connection Verification
- Verified Redis is responding to PING commands
- Tested SET/GET operations successfully
- Confirmed the application configuration matches the Redis setup

## Current Status

✓ Redis server is installed and running
✓ Redis is accessible on localhost:6379
✓ Connection tests pass successfully
✓ Application is configured correctly (redis://localhost:6379/0)

## Next Steps

**The application should now connect to Redis successfully when restarted.**

When you restart the Bolt AI Crypto API backend, you should see:
```
Redis connected successfully
```
Instead of the previous connection error.

## Redis Management Commands

### Check Redis Status
```bash
redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG
```

### Start Redis (if not running)
```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

### Stop Redis
```bash
sudo service redis-server stop
```

### Restart Redis
```bash
sudo service redis-server restart
```

### Check Redis Process
```bash
pgrep -l redis
```

### Redis CLI
```bash
redis-cli  # Interactive Redis command line
```

## Configuration Details

- **Redis URL**: redis://localhost:6379/0
- **Cache TTL**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Configuration File**: `/workspace/backend/config.py`

## Notes

- Redis is now running as a system service
- The application will automatically connect to Redis on startup
- If Redis is not running, the application will log a warning but continue without Redis (as designed)
- For production deployments, consider using Redis with persistence enabled and authentication
